This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript where a type error related to function overloading is not caught during compilation. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers and return their sum.  However, calling it with a string and a number leads to runtime error (NaN) rather than a compile time error. The solution showcases how to improve type safety using function overloads or type guards.
